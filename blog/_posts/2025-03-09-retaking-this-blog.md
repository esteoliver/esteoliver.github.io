resume: What does it take to bring an old habit back to life? it's been a long time since I've put my thought into words or even express with the sole purpose of sharing.

Our current world is full of means of expression: social media, video platforms, podcasts, and more. However, I have never felt comfortable actively participating in any platform. Not was I posting back in my teenage years in Facebook (although I was  there the whole time), not I'm posting in Instagram or TikTok. The last picture you'll find in my Instagram feed is from two years ago, and is a random picture of my cats.

I don't create posts because of some sense of superiority or because I'm trying to make a statement. I simply don't feel satisfaction from it. If I'm honest with myself I even feel insecure about anything that I post, why would the world care? 

### Post it here then!

Brilliant idea, why not just post in a blog? LA HIPOTENUSA. Makes no sense going from being a ghost in social media to want to open a window to my thoughts. But here I am, trying to make sense of it all.

If there's something I'm taking from this is that I'm doing this for myself. I'm not trying to make a statement, I'm not trying to be the next big thing, I'm not trying to be the next influencer. I'm just trying to express myself, to share my thoughts, to put my ideas into words. And if someone reads it, great! If not, that's fine too.

I recall a bit the filling the first time I sat down and wrote a post on my blog back in the day. Embarrassment from people reading for sure, but also the opposite sentiment, a bit of self-confidence. I would for sure cringe if I had to read whatever I was posting in 2016, but that is what old Esteban needed to cope with the situation of Venezuela and the uncertainty of the future.

Almost 10 years later and things are so different in my life. Now I live in Montevideo, I've been married for 5 years, got two cats in the process, peaking in my career. I've growth SO much, I have achieved so much, but still, uncertainty is always there: should we stay here or move to Europe? Should we have kids? Should I start a business?

It is just life after all, but I never stopped being that 8-years-old afraid of being an adult.


So, here I'm retaking this corner for myself and find some room breath with the hope of beating those things that scares me. I hope you can find some inspiration to find your corner and share as well.
