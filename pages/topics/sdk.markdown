A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools 
in one installable package.

An SDK can take the form of APIs in the form of on-device libraries of reusable 
functions used to interface to a particular programming language.

An SDK seems to be a complete set of APIs that allow you to perform most any action you would need to for creating applications. In addition an SDK may include other tools for developing for the platform/item that it is for.

An API on the other hand is just a series of related methods that may be good for a specific purpose.

As an example, the JDK (Java Development Kit) contains the API as well as the compilers, runtimes, and other miscellaneous tools. The Java API is simply all the libraries that make up the core language that you can work with out of the box.
