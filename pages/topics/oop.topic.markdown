Refers to a type of software design in which programmers define the data type of 
a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be 
applied to the data structure.

Abstraction: The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures.
Class: A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.
Encapsulation: The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.
Information hiding: The process of hiding details of an object or function. Information hiding is a powerful programming technique because it reduces complexity.
Inheritance: a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes.
Interface: the languages and codes that the applications use to communicate with each other and with the hardware.
Messaging: Message passing is a form of communication used in parallel programming and object-oriented programming.
Object: a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.
Polymorphism: A programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
Procedure: a section of a program that performs a specific task.

**CLASS** is a blueprint from which objects are created.
**OBJECT** is a instance of a class. object = state + behavior
