            I'm always improving my not-so-softs softskills, because a project is not only
            about code, is about the people that writes that code.
            <br><br>
            I have had the opportunity to lead and coach great teams.
            I learned a lot from them: how to communicate, solve conflict,
            and menthor new developers into their path careers.

            Software is always evolving, so as a software engineer/developer I can't stay behind.

            I value my time, and that's why when I'm solving a problem, I'm not just

            more value over time, and much less effort.<br><br>
            I'm not a hard worker. When facing a problem, I'm smart and creative.

            Beyond being a developer, I'm a Venezuelan man, born in a curious date
            (December 24), married to an amazing woman and father of a cat.
            I love playing games, watch a lot of movies and cook.       
            And even more than that.
