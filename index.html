        I had worked as a developer since 2016, mainly using RoR

          I'm always improving my not-so-softs softskills, because a project is not only
          about code, is about the people that writes that code.
          <br><br>
          I have had the opportunity to lead and coach great teams. <br class="d-none d-md-inline">
          I learned a lot from them: how to communicate, solve conflict,
          and menthor new developers into their path careers.

          I love to learn more. <br><br>
    
          Software is always evolving, so as a software engineer/developer I can't stay behind.
          Although my experience is limited to <b>Ruby</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, I try not<br>
          to be entangled to just one language or one technology. <br><br>
    
          I'm currently learning <b>Python</b>, <b>GoLang</b> and <b>Big Data</b>.

          I value my time, and that's why when I'm solving a problem, I'm not just 
          trying to fix it, I'm also trying to understand and learn. This generates
          more value over time, and much less effort.<br><br>
          I'm not a hard worker. When facing a problem, I'm smart and creative.

          People tens to forget that we are just humans, after all (8). Every day I 
          work with people, not machines. This is a very important feature for my team
          and workplace.<br><br>
          Beyond being a developer, I'm a Venezuelan man, born in a curious date <br>
          (December 24), married to an amazing woman and father of a cat. <br>
          I love playing games, watch a lot of movies and cook. <br><br>
    
          And much more than that...
