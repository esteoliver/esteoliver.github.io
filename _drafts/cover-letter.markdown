Hi there! I'm Esteban Oliveros,  a pragmatic software engineer and creative developer.

I have worked as a developer since 2016, mainly using RoR and NodeJs. I enjoy the process of building a modern world through code:
- +4 years developing SaaS, CRM and APIs, with experience in different languages (Ruby, Python, JS) and techonologies.
- Knowledge of good software practices, design patterns and systems architecture.
- Experience with Agile methodologies and teams.

I have worked with TravelContact (http://travelcontact.com/) as a Full Stack developer and Everfi (https://everfi.com/) as a Backend developer.
 
Beyond being a developer, I'm a Venezuelan man, currently living in Argentina, married to an amazing woman and father of a cat. I love playing games, watch a lot of movies and cook. And even more than that.
