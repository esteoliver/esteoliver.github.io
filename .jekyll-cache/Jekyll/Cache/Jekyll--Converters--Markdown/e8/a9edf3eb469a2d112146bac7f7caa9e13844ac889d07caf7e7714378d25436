<p>It’s been hard since a didn’t move to France. To have such a unique 
opportunity like that and miss it because of circunstances you can’t 
control… Damn you coronavirus, you kind of kill a part of me.</p>

<p>I have always been a guy that depends of his self esteem. Since I learn that
word (autoestima) I become very aware of that. And my self steem grow entangled
to my knowledge, my intelligence, and how smart other people perceived me. That
was back in 4th grade. I made of that my shell.</p>

<p>The first time I felt defeated in life was at the end of high school. I was not
able to get in any university: first, because I didn’t actually try,
and secondly, because I was so confident that I though I didn’t need to. My 
self steem became overconfidence, and I crashed.</p>

<p>Thanks to my luck, I got a second chance and got a bachelor’s degree on Computer Science, started working, move to Argentina, got a job opportunity in Paris, and
then, coronavirus…</p>

<p>I guess, the real reason why I’m so upset about this, is because it was… easy.</p>

<p>The opportunity came to me, I studied a little bit, tried by best on the 
interviews, and got the job. Dream job, relocation, all payed. And it went as 
easy as it came. I stopped my life thinking on the future and the future 
disappeared in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>And I stand still for two months…</p>

<p>Now, I’m back on the field, trying to find something new. People tell me, “You
are good, you’ll find something so easily”, but it feels like all the responses
from interviewers are “You’re not good enough, sorry”. And it hurts so much,
because I think this is all I have, and is not enough, and don’t know what to do 
to at least be enough.</p>

<p>No manager, boss, superior ever told me “You have to improve on X”, or “You
could learn Y”. And it feels like I’m 17 again, and I’m gonna crash.</p>

<p>The truth is that I can’t wait for someone to tell me that. It has to be me. I 
need someone to tell myself: “You are good, but you can be so much better”.
That’s how you should be your self steem. By believing in yourself, but 
knowing that you can always be better.</p>

<p>I won’t depend of luck any more. I’ll build my own path.</p>
