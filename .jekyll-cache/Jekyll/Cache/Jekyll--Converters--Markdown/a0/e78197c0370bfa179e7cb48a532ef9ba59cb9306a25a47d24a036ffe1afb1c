  <p>I think coding is a creative process. It involves logical processes and the 
creation of new structures. But at the end of the day it is you, and your own 
capacity of thinking outside the box that will let you achieve your goals. 
Problem solving is what drives my work, is my piece of art, but you can‚Äôt do it 
alone. Working with other people, with different approaches and lines of 
thoughts is the reason why I love what I do best.</p>
